        Role			    : Test Analyst<br/>
    </p>
    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>
        Automating a Web based enterprise management system allows you to oversee multiple aspects of your business through a single interface. Numerous types of EMS solutions are present in the market, and they require a lot of effort and expertise to use. Clients use these systems to manage sales channels, projects, human resources, and business accounting. 
        Building an automated testing solution that can check the workflow and operation of the software. Enterprise management systems usually have multiple test cases, so it becomes quite expensive for users to perform manual testing of every change occurring in the same. With Selenium, you can automate its manual tests, and thus, make them more efficient. 
        As the users of enterprise management systems are not much familiar with these scripts, we created a framework that simplifies the automation process for them. This way, even non-technical people can use your solution without facing any hindrances.
